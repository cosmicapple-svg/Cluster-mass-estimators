# Cluster-mass-estimators

In this repository you can find 4 different mass estimators for clusters of galaxies. This estimators are based on the work of Heisler & Bahcall (1985).

## Virial estimator
Under the assumption of virial equilibrium for clusters, we can obtain a simple expression for the mass of the system, i.e. the cluster, in terms of the
proyected distance between the galaxies ($R_{\perp, i j}$), the velocity on the line-of-sign ($V_z$) and the total number of members ($N$) as:

$$M_V = \dfrac{3 \pi N}{2 G} \dfrac{\sum_{i} V_{z, i}^2} {\sum_{i < j} \frac{1}{R_{\perp, i j}} }$$
